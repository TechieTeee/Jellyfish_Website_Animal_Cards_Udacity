                <!-- Jellyfish Additional Facts -->
                <p>Jellyfish are known for their vibrant, neon colors and translucent bodies. They are some of the most awe-inspiring creatures of the sea. There are more than 2,000 verified species in the world.While they are enticingly beautiful, many varieties they are extremely dangerous. These varieties excrete toxins upon being touched as a defense mechanism, and these toxins can be deadly to other animals and humans alike. Also, while domesticated jellyfish can live 2 -4 years on average, jellyfish in the wild can live much longer because of their ability to revert to larva and reproduce asexually. This makes it challenging to determine the exact age of the longest living jellyfish, and many scientists have deemed them "immortal". </p>
